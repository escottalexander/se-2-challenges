# Base Challenge Extension Template
> ⚠️ This is not meant to be used as an extension by itself. Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-guide-and-hints-to-create-new-challenges) to see how to use this set of files.

You can use these files to help set up a new extension that matches the style and feel of [SpeedRunEthereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/).

There are `// CHALLENGE-TODO:` comments placed throughout that provide instructions on key changes to adapt this template for use with a new challenge.
